# BAND
Business Analytics Nanodegree Program
  
  
 Utilizing the skills and knowledge I learned in the various sections I completed 3 major projects:
- I carried out an in-depth analysis of New York Stock Exchange data and created both visualizations of this data, and a dynamic financial forecast of business outcomes.
- I used SQL to query a music store database to answer specific business questions, and all of my queries incorporated both joins and aggregations to acquire desired information.
- I built interactive data dashboards in Tableau using 2015 US Census data to extract meaningful insights, create clear visualizations, and effectively communicate my findings.
